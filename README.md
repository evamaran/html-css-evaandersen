# RainyDays website for HTML and CSS course

This assignment was to create a responsive website using the RainyDays model created in Figma during the Design Course. I created this with a focus on the provided marking guide, paying special attention to responsiveness across screen sizes, semantic HTML, DRY CSS, a well-working navigation and accessible navigation and overall usability.

## Live version

The website is published via GitHub:
[https://evamaran.github.io/html-css-evaandersen/](https://evamaran.github.io/html-css-evaandersen/)

## Folder structure

- index.html - Homepage
- css/main.css - Main stylesheet that imports my other CSS files
- images/ - Contains all images used in this project
- README.md - This file

## Validation and testing

- HTML and CSS validated using W3C validator
- Tested in Chrome, Firefox, and mobile (iPhone)
- Accessibility checks: color contrast and keyboard navigation
- Verified clean experience in incognito mode

## What I learned

- Structure HTML to make it easy to read and follow
- Create and work with stylesheets and mediaqueries
- The importance of testing in final environment
- Troubleshooting makes me want to pull out all my hair, but in the end it is very rewarding!

## Future improvements

I hope future assignments will allow me to:
- Add a cart functionality that will display the actual product added to it
- Make cooler animations and effects
- Have buttons that create actions.
